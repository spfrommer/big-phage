BigPhage is a 2d Java game engine using LWJGL for rendering and JBox2D for physics.  It is the successor to the Phage2d game engine.

BigPhage is an Eclipse project and depends on gltools (https://github.com/vastsuperking/gltools) and gltools-materials (https://github.com/vastsuperking/gltools-materials).  For easy installation, simply clone all three repositories into the same Eclipse workspace.
